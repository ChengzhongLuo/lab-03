## Lab Question Answers

Answer for Question 1: 
	RESTful APIs are scalable as they can optimize client-server interactions, which increases performance and avoids problems with communication. This happens because the APIs don't need to remember past client information.
	
Answer for Question 2:
	Resources are essentially the data or information that an application provides to a client. The mail server provides the client with the inbox, the mail titles, and the contents of the mail as well. 
	
Answer for Question 3:
	One common REST method not used in the mail implementation was a PUT method, which is used to update a resource. We could implement this method by creating a way to update the inbox to check for new mail or to have a message thread (with replies) that has update functionality to check to see a reply.
	
Answer for Question 4:
	Essentially, API keys provide identification and authorization of the API project that you want to use. Moreover, many RESTful API providers want to ensure that only their clients who have permission can access their API and also want to reduce the chance of being hacked.
